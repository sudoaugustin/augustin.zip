Supercharge your browser by embedding real websites to your homepage instead of shortcut icons. You can easily change the size and position of these websites. It’s like a design tool where you can draw and embed websites instead of sketches.

  | Portal loads a webpage only when it's in view. Even if 100 webpages are embedded, the network request will be sent only when the webpage enters the view. | Portal doesn't flush out the webpage when it's out of view as it may need to be refetched again when in view. |

## Notes
- Portal is safe to use and doesn't collect any user data.
- Portal overrides some network requests to embed a website in a safer way using [declarativeNetRequest](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/declarativeNetRequest#:~:text=declarativeNetRequest%20API%20is%20used%20to,content%2C%20thus%20providing%20more%20privacy.).
- Portal ensures the network requests are overridden only in the homepage and doesn't effect your other webpages.
- Although Portal overrides network requests, some websites use javascript to detect if it's embedded. Portal may not work well with those websites.
