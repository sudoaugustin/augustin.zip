      <br /> <br />
      <p>
        <i>Adam:</i> What, Asia??? Huge Timezone difference dude! Better luck with next job.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Augustin:</i> I can explain. You said the important hours to overlap is 9am-1pm which is 7:30pm-11:30pm in my local time during
        when my brain work the most. Yeah, my brain so active during night. So I can be available from 4am-1pm according to your timezone.
      </p>
      <br /> <br />
      <p>
        <i>Adam:</i> OK! I'm listening.
      </p>

        <i>Augustin:</i> About me. I got into programming when I'm 16 year old at my university. Before that, I don't know what is
        programming or how the code are written. I don't know anything.
        <br /> <br />
        My first language was C++(I forgot everything about C++ now, only JS,TS is flowing through my veins). My first project was password
        manager with C++.
        <br /> <br />
        At 2nd year, I learned Java(the nightmare) and Javascript. I didn't like Javascript at first, my first love was PHP. I got
        interested in the payment system during that time, so I competed in a web competition and won Technical
        Award(https://witaward.com/result/2019). After that I learned about payment methods and difference between cash usage in Europe and
        Asia. I also learned Laravel Basic.
        <br /> <br />I learned React and NodeJS during covid period. I got my first job as a frontend developer in a Singapore company
        2years ago. At my job, I primarily work on client projects and during free office hours I and my team work on nextjs boilerplate.

      <br /> <br />
      <p>
        <i>Adam:</i> Could you tell me about some of the projects you are proud of.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Augustin:</i> Well, I have three.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        First is "Supex". It's a cross-browser extension tool, I release this year. This is my favourite project of all time. But I failed
        to attract developers attention. You can see about the project{' '}
        <a href="https://supex.dev/" className="shine">
          here
        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Second is "VSLook". A VSCode extension which let you create your own VSCode theme with TailwindCSS colors. It was the most
        challenging project for me. It has 7K installs. You can see the project{' '}
        <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sudoaugustin.vslook" className="shine">
          here
        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Last one is "TailwindCSS Transpiler". It was my first side project. It's a VSCode extension which transpile tailwindcss into purecss
        on file save. This extension has 51K installs. You can see{' '}
        <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sudoaugustin.tailwindcss-transpiler" className="shine">
          here
        </a>
        . I also release a Atom version of TailwindCSS Transpiler but I unpublished due to very low installs.
      </p>
      <br />

      .
      <br /> <br />
      <p>
        <i>Adam:</i> Do you wanna add something in the application?
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Augustin: </i> Yes, I do have a hearing problem. I'm not deaf. But I have problem of interpreting words when the person speak
        sudden fast.
      </p>
      <br /> <br />
      <p>
        <i>Adam:</i> OK!! You are not hired anyway due to timezone difference. Better luck with next job.
