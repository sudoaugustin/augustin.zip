Supercharge browser New Tab by embedding real websites instead of shortcut icons. Portal lets you embed your favorite day-to-day websites in New Tab. You can also adjust the size and position of the website easily. So when you want a specific breakpoint of a website, you don't have exit full screen to minimize your window anymore. It's like a design tool but you are drawing & embedding live websites. For feedbacks, please contact [here](https://x.com/sudoaugustin).

## Downloads

- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-portal/)
- [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/portal/edgabbnbdacnalfdbabbcpphbkcfpgid)


## Performance

**Network aspect:** Portal loads a webpage only when it's in viewport. So even if you have like 100 webpages embedded, the network request will be sent only when the webpage enters the viewport. 

**Memory aspect:** Currently, Portal doesn't flush out the webpage when it's out of viewport as it may need to be refetched again when in viewport. But I may give that as a option in future version to chose whether the user prefer memory or network performance.

## Notes

- Portal is safe to use and doesn't collect any user data.
- Portal overrides some network requests to embed a live website in a safer way using [declarativeNetRequest](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/declarativeNetRequest#:~:text=declarativeNetRequest%20API%20is%20used%20to,content%2C%20thus%20providing%20more%20privacy.).
- Portal ensures the network requests are overridden only in the new tab(empty url page) and doesn't effect your other web pages.
- Although Portal overrides network requests, some websites use javascript to detect if it's embedded. Portal may not work well with those websites.
