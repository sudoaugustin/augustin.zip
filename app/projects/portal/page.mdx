Transform useless new tabs into a mini browser by embedding real websites instead of shortcut icons. With Portal, you can embed your favorite day-to-day websites in the new tab. It's like a design tool except you are drawing & embedding a live website. You can also adjust the size and position of the websites. So when you want a specific breakpoint of a website, you don't have to minimize your window anymore.

## Security

- Portal is safe to use and doesn't collect any user data.
- Portal overrides some network requests to embed a live website in a safer way using [declarativeNetRequest](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/declarativeNetRequest#:~:text=declarativeNetRequest%20API%20is%20used%20to,content%2C%20thus%20providing%20more%20privacy.).
- Portal ensures the network requests are overridden only in the new tab(empty url page) and doesn't effect your other web pages.

## Notes

- Although Portal overrides network requests, some websites use javascript to detect if it's embedded. Portal may not work well with those websites.
